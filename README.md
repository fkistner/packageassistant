PackageAssistant
================
*Mac OS X package manager*

*Package Assistant* is a little tool to manage OS X packages. You can check their integrity (whether their files are correctly installed or not) or you can remove them. 

**Why?** 

> When I first met OS X I was amazed by the way applications
> were installed and uninstalled (by drag-and-dropping),
> that's why I got a little disappointed when I found out
> that there were some files (.pkg and .mpkg) that couldn't
> be uninstalled from the system unless the vendor of each
> package provided an uninstaller. I decided to make my
> first OS X app to solve this issue. [Facundo Carreiro]
